In this project I used HTML to create a Indian Cusine list.

The main things which i learned doing this project are:
1. html basic syntax
2. image tag
3. anchor tag
4. concepts about different heading
5. ordered vs unordered list 
6. sub and sup tag
7. id attribute aka name

If anyone wants to add more cusine feel free to make a PR, just keep the structure of recipes page same.
