    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is an authentic Indian Naan recipe. I have made this many times. It
      goes well with Indian curry which has a lot of gravy, such as the Butter
      Chicken.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
      </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>cup ghee</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon plain yoghurt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon kalonji (onion seed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk the warm water with the yeast and sugar until the yeast is
        dissolved. Cover and let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift flour and salt three times into a large bowl add the yeast mixture,
        half of the ghee and all the yogurt. Mix into a soft dough then knead on
        a floured surface for about 5 minutes or until dough is smooth and
        elastic. Place the dough in a large greased bowl, cover and let stand in
        a warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until the dough is doubled in size .
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch down dough then knead for 5 minutes. Divide dough into 6 pieces.
        Roll each piece out into 8 inch round naans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover an oven tray with foil and grease the foil. Brush the naan with a
        little of the remaining ghee and sprinkle with some of the kalonji. Cook
        naan one at a time under the broiler for about 2 minutes on each side or
        until puffed and just browned.
      </li>
